# Project Idea/Inspo

I really wanted to make a keyboard to just gain insights on how electronics like keyboards work. After doing the hackpad, I got inspired to make a full keyboard looking at the keyboards other members made. Welp how hard can it be :smile:

Total time spent: 1h 

# Day 1: June 12th, 2025

## Time Spent: 1h
Started the schematic and spent time deciding my keyboard schematic. It will be a keycool84 keyboard with a rotary encoder or 2. (we'll see).
