# Project Idea/Inspo

I really wanted to make a keyboard to just gain insights on how electronics like keyboards work. After doing the hackpad, I got inspired to make a full keyboard looking at the keyboards other members made. Welp how hard can it be :smile:

Inspo- https://www.montechpc.com/mkey-tkl

Total time spent: 11h 

# Day 1: June 12th, 2025

## Time Spent: 2h
Started the schematic and spent time deciding my keyboard schematic. It will be a TKL keyboard with a rotary encoder.
Made a matrix on MS Paint to understand how the basic structure of my PCB and firmware will be. Watched some videos on how keyboards work.

# Day 2: June 13th, 2025

## Time Spent: 9h
Literally spent the entire day researching, asking people questions in slack (i love everyone is so helpful) and I basically completed the entire schematic and assigned all footprints. Made a basic draft of my BOM and thats about it. 
I did struggle so much on figuring out how microcontrollers work and which one will I need. I also had a hard time assigning footprints but I pulled through. 
My goal for tomorrow will definitly be to make the PCB and start the 3D modeling.
